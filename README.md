### GitHub Pages setup

The CDN-backed production version of the site is running on GitHub Pages, directed to http://bluegreenway.org/ via a [`CNAME` file](https://github.com/stamen/bluegreenway/blob/gh-pages/CNAME). The deploy script uses [`git-directory-deploy`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-directory-deploy) to push only `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch.
